                    Apple revealed the Apple Watch SE 3, the updated budget model featuring significant new enhancements that bring premium features to the affordable smartwatch segment. This latest iteration combines the best of Apple's technology with an accessible price point, making advanced health tracking and smartwatch functionality available to a broader audience.
                </p>

                <h2>New Chip & Always-On Display</h2>
                <p>
                    The Apple Watch SE 3 is powered by the new S10 processor, delivering enhanced performance and efficiency compared to previous SE models. This powerful chip enables smoother animations, faster app launches, and improved overall responsiveness throughout the user interface.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of the most significant upgrades is the addition of an always-on display, a feature previously reserved for the more expensive Apple Watch Series models. This means you can now see the time, date, and important information at a glance without needing to raise your wrist or tap the screen.
                </p>

                <h2>Advanced Health & Gesture Features</h2>
                <p>
                    The Apple Watch SE 3 introduces several new health monitoring capabilities, including sleep apnea detection and retrospective ovulation estimates. These features provide valuable insights into your health and wellness, helping you make informed decisions about your lifestyle and habits.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The watch also includes a temperature sensor that can track changes in your body temperature over time, providing additional data for health monitoring and fitness tracking. This sensor works in conjunction with other health features to provide a comprehensive picture of your well-being.
                </p>

                <p>
                    New gesture controls include wrist-flick and double-tap functionality, allowing you to interact with your watch without touching the screen. These intuitive gestures make it easier to use your watch during workouts or when your hands are occupied.
                </p>
