## 🔍 How It Works

### **Login Process**
1. User visits `/admin.html`
2. Login screen appears
3. User enters password
4. System validates password
5. If correct: Access granted + session created
6. If wrong: Attempt counter incremented
7. After 5 wrong attempts: Account locked

### **Session Management**
1. Successful login creates session token
2. Session expires after 30 minutes
3. System checks session validity every minute
4. Expired sessions automatically log out user

### **Security Layers**
1. **Password Protection** - Blocks unauthorized access
2. **Session Timeout** - Prevents long-term unauthorized access
3. **Account Lockout** - Prevents brute force attacks
4. **Auto-logout** - Clears sessions on browser close

6. **IMMEDIATELY** change password

### **Account Locked**

2. Try logging in again
3. If still locked, clear browser data
4. Use default password to login
5. **IMMEDIATELY** change password

### **Session Expired Too Quickly**
1. Edit `admin-script.js`
2. Increase `sessionTimeout` value
3. Save and refresh page
